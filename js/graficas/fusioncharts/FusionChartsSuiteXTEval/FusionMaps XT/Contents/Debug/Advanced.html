Many browsers restrict JavaScript from accessing local file system owing to security reasons. The JavaScript maps, when running locally, will not be able to access data provided as a URL. If you run the files from a server, it will run absolutely fine, as the   data is then read and streamed by the server, without the need for   JavaScript to directly access local file system. When running locally, however, if you provide the data as string (using the <a href="../how_fm_work/DataXMLExp.html">Data String</a> method), it works fine. </p>    </td>

      <p>FusionMaps XT (core) had been coded in ActionScript 2 (Flash 8 - AVM1). We haven't ported them to ActionScript 3 (AVM2); instead, we have modified the existing FusionMaps XT SWF files - so that, they can load efficiently in your Flex solutions and then be controlled by your Flex code.
        
        As such, you need not bother about cross AVM issues. All that is to be done is to load the FusionCharts specialized SWF and SWC files, provide the data, and control it from your Flex project.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p>Please note that in order to use any multi-lingual characters on the map, you necessarily need to use UTF-8 encoded XML/JSON. More importantly, the XML/JSON file or stream requires UTF-8 BOM stamp to be present as the very first 3 Bytes of the file. Most of the text editors like Notepad can do this automatically. To know more on how to BOM mark a file, please read Using <a href="../advanced/special_chars/SpChar.html">Multi-lingual text</a> page in <strong>Advanced Topics &gt; Using special characters</strong> section. </p>
      <p>Please note the two basic thumb rules: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> For <a href="../how_fm_work/DataURL.html">Data URL</a> method - the XML/JSON should be having the BOM stamp</li>
      <li>For <a href="../how_fm_work/DataXMLExp.html">Data String</a> method - the HTML/application file containing the XML/JSON should have the BOM stamp. </li>
      </ul>
    <p class="highlightBlock">BOM is Byte Order Mark. It is 'EF BB EF' - these 3 bytes in case of UTF-8 encoded files, the BOM being placed at the very beginning of the file. It is an indicator that the file contains UTF-8 encoded strings. Also, please note that specifying the encoding setting i.e., <span class="codeInline">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;</span> in the XML header region does not add the Byte Order Mark (BOM) to the XML/JSON file. </p>
    <p> However, please note that FusionMaps XT supports only left-to-right languages, as of now. It doesn't have native support for right-to-left languages like Hebrew. So, if you want to use Hebrew with FusionMaps XT, you'll have to programmatically reverse the sequence of words/characters and then provide the same to FusionCharts.</p></td>

    <p>Also, if you are willing to export the maps directly as images (JPG/JPEG/PNG/PDF directly) without rendering it in the browser, please note that our developers have created a .NET based server-side Image Saver Assembly that allows exporting maps as images without rendering it in the browser. Please note that this works only using  .Net framework of Windows. This is an internal implementation, which is not included and/or associated with the FusionMaps XT pack.
